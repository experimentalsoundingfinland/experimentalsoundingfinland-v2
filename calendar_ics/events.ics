SUMMARY:ANNIKA FUHRMANN & TOM LÖNNQVIST
DESCRIPTION:Annika Fuhrmann, ihmisääni & efektit / voice & effects
Tom Lönnqvist, modulaarisyntetisaattori / modular synthesizer

Annika Fuhrmann is a versatile singer, musician, and sound artist, who is most at home in the fields of experimental music theater, sound art, improvisation, and contemporary music. Annika has premiered several works composed for her and has performed in interdisciplinary projects with artists from various fields. At the moment, she is drawn to honesty, roughness, incompleteness, and vulnerability in music making instead of technical perfection. Annika is eager to experiment with new working methods and constantly seeks new ways to express herself. This has also led to collaboration with Tom Lönnqvist.
Tom Lönnqvist is a sound, space, and performance artist based in Helsinki. He holds a master’s degree in sound and has been part of several acclaimed dance and theater productions. Tom’s artistic work includes working with body, modular synthesis, video, installation, painting, drums, and ambisonic field recordings. Collaboration with Annika Fuhrmann has emerged from an interest in exploring the potential of modulating the human voice as part of instantaneous composition made with electronic modular synthesis.
The German electronic music label Mille Plateaux has released Annika’s and Tom’s debut performance.

SUMMARY:Thirteen Encounters
DESCRIPTION:For her first doctoral concert Livia Schweizer will present a version of the ’Thirteen Changes’ by Pauline Oliveros collaborating with other six musicians and improvisers.
The score will be explored and performed by various combinations of musicians and instruments within the group, ranging from solos and duos to tutti. Each piece will serve as an opportunity for every player to delve into diverse ’encounters’ between sonorities, personalities, aesthetics, and musical languages. This approach aims to celebrate the interaction of different aesthetics and individual voices united by a shared score, enabling multiple narratives to coexist.

For example, what would you do if you would be asked to play a piece about 'rollicking monkeys landing on Mars'? 

performers: 
Livia Schweizer, flutes and concept

SUMMARY:Heli Hartikainen – CHRONOVARIATIONS
DESCRIPTION:CHRONOVARIATIONS on 3D-ääniteos tenorisaksofonille, live-elektroniikalle ja resonoiville metalliromuille. Hyödynnämme teoksessa elektromagneettisia aktuaattorikaiuttimia, jotka resonanssin avulla muuttavat romuttamolta pelastetut metallipellit ja -putket jännittäviksi äänilähteiksi, joiden äänellisiin ominaisuuksiin kuuluvat niin hienot yläsävelresonanssit kuin rajut särötkin.

Levy on mainittu brittiläisessä The Guardianissa ja soinut kuululla NTS-kanavalla. Muun muassa näin siitä sanottiin Ylellä:

”Ja millaista musiikkia se olikaan? Kauniita hälyääniä saksofonin läpistä, ilma virtauksesta, ja saksofonin kielityksestä. Outoja ääniä, jotka kiertävät tilaan ripustetuissa metalliromuissa, ja äänitetään vielä oudompina uudelleen. Levollista viipyilyä sävelten tai sävelikköjen ympärillä, ja kaikki taltioituna akustiikassa joka antaa äänelle ja kuulijalle kaiken tarvittavan tilan.
Ehdin kuunnella levyä melkein 15 minuuttia ennen kuin jouduin palaamaan lapsiperheen äänimaailmaan, ja se olikin paras 15 minuuttia pitkään aikaan – se oli puhdistava rituaali. Levysoitin, vinyyli ja äänen konkretia kiinnittivät minut tähän maailmaan, mutta musiikki vapautti minut siitä.” event_venue123 Temppeliaukion kirkko

Unfortunately the space where the event takes place is not completely an accessible one.
There is a ramp to the front door but after that there are from 3 to 5 steps inside and the ramp next to them is too steep to go up alone with a wheelchair. You can then reach the 2nd floor by elevator, but you can’t get to the elevator without someone opening the door. So please come with someone who can help or contact the organisers and they’ll help.

In the third edition of Suhina Klubi for the spring 2025, we are proud to host vocalist/flutist/composer Josefiina Vannesluoma.

Josefiina Vannesluoma is a vocalist, flutist, composer and improviser based in Helsinki, Finland. Her vocal versatility and unique genre-fluid compositions for her ensembles Mortal Lease and Signe have enchanted publics and reviews around Northern Europe and gained her three nominations for the Finnish Jazz Record of the Year and an honorary mention for Teosto Award. She also sings with the Teosto Prize awarded Mikko Sarvanne Garden. She is a Jazz Major alumnus from University of Arts Helsinki.

"..the star of the event was vocalist Josefiina Vannesluoma, who sometimes sounded like an opera singer and often took on very different characters with her voice. In the wildest of them, she had whole conversations alone in completely made-up languages, whose intonation was at a startling level, and also really fun to watch, —"

SUMMARY:Suhina Klubi: Luurankouni
DESCRIPTION:Suhina Klubi serves as a platform for improvised and experimental music and sound art within Helsinki. During the year 2025 we present improvised music ensembles from Finland and abroad.

In the fifth edition of Suhina Klubi for the spring 2025, we are proud to host duo Luurankouni.

LUURANKOUNI (‘skeleton dream’) is the duo of double bassist Félicie Bazelaire (FR) and electric guitarist Lauri Hyvärinen (FI). Borrowed from a Finnish translation of poems by the 15th-century Japanese poet Ikkyū, the name reflects the duo’s desire to strip away the surface to reveal an essential form, in all its dread. Inspired by Ikkyū’s themes of mortality, impermanence, and sensuality, the duo’s work explores the fragile dualism between presence and absence in sound.

Bazelaire and Hyvärinen intially met during a quartet concert with Léo Dupleix and Taku Sugimoto at Laterna Magica in 2019 in Helsinki where they improvised and played each other's compositions. Their duo work began at 26 Chaises in Paris in April 2023.
Influenced by the spirit of Wandelweiser, field-recordings and drone music, Bazelaire and Hyvärinen improvise within a tacitly defined space. They create a sober, minimalist music, within which a discourse is developed through the choice of timbres. The lightness of the guitar's harmonics contrasts with the grain of the bow on the double bass string.
The two musicians have researched the potential of their respective instruments thoroughly in a variety of experimental improvisational and compositional contexts, continuously collaborating and disseminating their work internationally. Their work has been presented by record labels such as Confront Recordings, Dinzu Artefacts, Edition Wandelweiser Records, Ftarri, Intonema, Hitorri and NUNC. Their collaborators include Clara de Asís, Angharad Davies, Léo Dupleix, Seijiro Murayama, Taku Sugimoto, Minami Saeki and Stefan Thut.

JUHO TUOMAINEN
Juho Tuomainen is an ambient guitarist who creates improvised atmospheres as a vehicle for meditation. His calm and contemplative sound reflects his feelings on the impermanence of the human condition, as well as his affection towards the delicate nature of Japanese aesthetics. With a creative use of a looper, he likes to build imaginary environments, while letting the music breathe and speak for itself. Through his music, Juho wants to bring us back to our innermost questions and remind us that we are here only for a short while.
On December 15th 2024 Juho Tuomainen released the first single from his upcoming album.

TEEA AARNIO & WILSON TANNER SMITH
Teea Aarnio and Wilson Tanner Smith represents a delicate meeting of many musical backgrounds across improvisation, electronics and interdisciplinary performance.
Smith is a cellist, composer, and multi-instrumentalist from the contemporary and free jazz/free improvisation communities of Chicago, with a sensitive approach to sound and space, often creating work for site-specific performances drawing from the latent sound, historical, and cultural associations of a given place and moment.
Aarnio is a global-facing Helsinki based vocalist, composer, improviser, songwriter, activist and interdisciplinary artist. Her works draws inspiration from the various never-ending decolonial processes, and the wide experience that she holds from working with different art forms. She's especially passionate about exploring all the possibilities that voice holds within an instrumentalist approach.
Her trilingual folk fusion debut album 'Väki' has received international praise and interest.

He has collaborated with various ensembles, and his music has been released and performed internationally. Toikkanen has also worked as an event organizer, curator, sound engineer, and workshop leader. He views his art as a diary—an ongoing reflection of a specific time and place, shaped by the interests and resonances that move him in the moment.

SUMMARY:SoundScapes #5 - Day 1
DESCRIPTION:Allbee, Calcanile, Edwards, Freedman, Castrillón, Kaufmann, Kujala, Mureddu, Kääriäinen, Schiaffini, Sjöström, Wachsmann, Vandeweyer

Toukokuun alussa Espoon kulttuurikeskuksen Louhisaliin kokoontuu kolmetoista modernin improvisoidun avantgardemusiikin virtuoosia. Kaksipäiväinen SoundScapes #5-festivaali kutsuu juhlimaan hetkellisesti sävelletyn musiikin ainutlaatuisuutta ja monimuotoisuutta. SoundScapes konsertti-iltojen aikana teokset muodostuvat uniikeiksi luomuksiksi, nykyisyyden hetkellisiksi ilmentymiksi, jotka ovat olemassa vain "tässä ja nyt" haihtuen sen jälkeen jälleen seuraavaan improvisaation osaksi. Yleisö pääsee todistamaan ja osallistumaan kokonaisvaltaiseen taide-elämykseen, joka herää eloon puhtaan tilaäänikokemuksen myötä. Taidemuotona hetkellinen sävellys perustuu täysin vapaaseen improvisaatioon, jossa muusikot toimivat samanaikaisesti sekä säveltäjinä että esiintyjinä. Sävellysprosessit ovat aina arvaamattomia ja tarjoavat siksi runsaasti mahdollisuuksia uusille kuuntelu- ja havaintokokemuksille. Taiteenlaji vaatii artisteilta korkeaa musikaalisuutta ja vahvaa halua luoda ja juhlistaa orkestraalista ensemble-soundia.

SUMMARY:Select your player 
DESCRIPTION:Select Your Player is an interactive performance where four improvisers take the audience on a
sonic journey inspired by game concepts composed specifically for this occasion. In the first piece,
the audience follows the performers through a game of snakes and ladders. The second piece
plunges the audience into a frantic race between the musicians: who will be the first to win the
game? The audience is invited to participate and interfere in the race... The final piece explores
listening and the subtle communication between musicians, where the game rules are sometimes...
bent. An invitation to participate, listen, and experiment.
Players:
Jan Škrobánek, piano
Laura Mehmeti, accordion
Franziska Fundelić, flute
Jaime Estévez Moreira, saxophone

SUMMARY:Dear Society, : Club Grief
DESCRIPTION:Club Grief is a club night for all grievers and friends. 

Club Grief is born out of the wish to allow grievers or grieving individuals to go clubbing in times where a normal club might not feel as the safest option. Dancing, clubbing and music hold the potential to host grief and to let grief come to the surface, yet, most clubs are high-threshold for grieving individuals due to the pressure to perform in a certain (happy/uplifted/party-proof/exhilarating/excited) way. 

There is little room for tears on the dancing floor and Club Grief tries to change that. We invite all types of grievers to bring their grief to the dancing floor, whatever this might look like.The anonymity and the freedom of emotions on the dancing floor can act facilitating in the navigation of the sometimes new or scary feelings of loss and grief, while dancing and movement can help us deal with emotional pain.

Welcome to Club Grief with music provided by Death by Landscape and M Lore, come to dance, cry and hold each other or take a little breather in the soft space by Leik Silvestrini.

SUMMARY:Fredagar på Sibbe: Judith Hamann
DESCRIPTION:Judith Hamann is a composer/performer born in Narrm/Melbourne, and currently based in Berlin. Described as an “extraordinary Australian cellist” (the Guardian), and as a composer who “destroys the fiction of the musician who lives and works outside conventional parameters and puts in its place a series of compositions that are fundamentally humane” (WIRE), their work encompasses performance, electro-acoustic composition, site specific generative work, and micro-tonal systems in a process based creative practice.

In recent research, Hamann examines the acts of shaking and humming as formal and intimate encounters; interrogates ‘collapse’ as a generative imaginary surface; and considers the ‘de-mastering’ of bodies, both human and non-human, in settler-colonial heritage instrumental practice and pedagogy.

Judith has performed widely with festivals including Tectonics (Glasgow, Athens etc.), UnSound (NYC), Sonic Acts (Amsterdam), Maerzmusik (Berlin), CTM (Berlin), the Venice Biennale Musica (Venice), Tokyo Experimental Festival (Tokyo), and AURAL (Mexico City). Judith enjoys thinking and working with other artists which includes people like Marja Ahti, Joshua Bonnetta, Pascale Criton, Charles Curtis, Sarah Hennies, Yvette Janine Jackson, and Anike Joyce Sadiq. Judith’s work has previously been published by labels including Blank Forms, Black Truffle, Another Timbre, and Longform Editions. Judith holds a Doctor of Musical Arts from UC San Diego.

SUMMARY:Life after meta: where should the community go?
DESCRIPTION:The recent political events surrounding X and Meta have given new urgency to the issues behind corporate social media and their unethical, politically unviable and unsustainable practices. Many among us have expressed their wish to leave, but are facing disorientation, fear of isolation and loss of connection as well as useful organisational tools.

We would like to invite you all (artists, organisers, audiences or simply curious people) to participate to an informal open discussion on these themes, where we can voice concerns, discuss alternatives and possible strategies, or simply get together and have tea or coffee and celebrate the improvements in the heating system 🔥.

In particular, we are interested in discussing with the sonic communities, fears, wishes, and needs in this regard and hopefully start imagining together some alternatives to corporate solutions, with special attention to open source, decentralised tools for building and consolidating our communities, online and offline.

The event will also be streamed. Broadcast stream and recording by Station of Commons.

SUMMARY:Interventio 1: Anla Courtis, Tomutonttu
DESCRIPTION:Circle’s PISTE exhibition at the Pori Art Museum will also serve as a venue for a series of musical visits and interventions, kind of artistic intermissions. The series of performances will begin on Thursday 13 February at 16:00 with Anla Courtis and Tomutonttu. The artists have been invited by Jussi Lehtisalo of Circle and Ektro Records. The performances are included in the price of the museum ticket.

Anla Courtis is a musician and composer from Buenos Aires. Courtis’ experimental music combines sound samples and manipulations with both traditional and special, self-made, instruments. Courtis has released hundreds of recordings as a solo artist and in numerous collaborative projects. He is a founding member of the Argentinian 90’s cult band Reynols.

Tomutonttu is a solo project by Tampere-based multi-artist Jan Anderzén. Anderzén, a visual artist working with textiles, drawings, prints and sound sculptures, is as a musician best known for his work with the band Kemialliset Ystävät, founded in 1995. Tomutonttu’s music is a collage of different sounds, sometimes recognisable from the animal world, and electronic experimental music. event_venue123 Porin taidemuseo

SUMMARY:Soiva Taidehalli: Tomutonttu
DESCRIPTION:Soiva Taidehalli 2025 konserttisarjan ensimmäisessä konsertissa kuullaan kokeellista elektronista musiikkia.

Parikymmentä vuotta sitten Jan Anderzén otti vastaan tehtävän: tuoda Tomutontun musiikkia ihmiskorvin kuultavaksi ja kurkistaa tylsän tuolle puolen, missä määrää vaihtoehtoinen logiikka. Pyrkimyksenä on kommunikoida pos/neg -akseleista piittaamattomia välähdyksiä mysteeristä, tietämättömyydestä, ja tehdä se riemastuttavasti.

Tomutontun konsertti esitetään sunnuntaina 23. helmikuuta osana taiteilija Jan Anderzénin omaa nykytaidenäyttelyä Porvoon Taidehallissa.

Tontut edustavat alkuperäistä lisättyä todellisuutta. Tomutontun musiikki nousee satunnaisen joutomaapöpelikön svengistä, eikä ”sävellyksen” ja ”tuotannon” välille voi tehdä eroa. Kaikki tapahtuu liian nopeasti, muttei tarpeeksi nopeasti. Miksi musiikki toisinaan vaikuttaa meihin niin voimakkaasti? Tämän kysymyksen kipinästä Tomutonttu syntyi.

SUMMARY:ANLA COURTIS (ARG) // VERDE
DESCRIPTION:ANLA COURTIS (ARG):
Alan (Anla) Courtis, legendaarisen Reynols-yhtyeen perustajajäsen, työskentelee väsymättä äänitaiteen, elektroakustisen musiikin, drone- ja noise-musiikin, improvisaation ja sävellyksen parissa.
Hänen musiikissaan on aina läsnä vahva kokeellisuus ja sen elementteinä voivat olla mm. preparoidut äänet, nauhamanipulaatiot, kenttätallenteet, live-elektroniikka, esineet tai syntetisaattorit. Courtis käyttää konserteissaan myös perinteisiä soittimia sekä itse rakentamiaan epätavallisempia soittimia, kuten kieletöntä kitaraa.
Courtis on ollut residenssitaiteilijana muun muassa EMS:ssä (Tukholma), GRM:ssä (Pariisi) ja Cafe Oto:ssa (Lontoo). Hänen diskografiansa kattaa yli 500 julkaisua sekä soolona että kollaboraatioina. Tunnetuimmista yhteistyökumppaneista mainittakoon vaikka Pauline Oliveros, Phill Niblock, Keiji Haino, Merzbow, Lee Ranaldo ja Jim O'Rourke.

VERDE saapuu esiintymään trio kokoonpanolla:
MIKA RINTALA on suomalaisen analogisen syntetisaattorin rakentamisen harvoja kansainvälisesti tunnettuja toimijoita. Julkaissut 30 soololevyä soittaa yli 50 levyllä. Tehnyt yli 200 musiikkivideota Vimeoon. Yli 500 sävellystä elektroakustista/jazzia. Verde soittimet edustavat myös omalaatuista tyylillistä ajattelua, joka laajenee syntetisaattorirakentamisen lisäksi myös erilaisiin innovatiivisiin kielisoittimiin. Verde on kehittänyt myös äänittämiseen ja ääneen liittyvää muuta teknologiaa, mm. mikrofonitekniikkaa, kaiutintekniikkaa ja äänitystekniikkaa. Verde soundi on uniikki aidoilla soittimilla tehtyä laadukkaasti äänitettyä, jossa soittajat kuuluvat sellaisina mitä he ovat. Hyvä esimerkki on Otto Donnerin kanssa yhteistyönä tehty Verde Otto-levy. Tämän lisäksi Rintala on julkaissut lukuisia elektronisen musiikin albumeja nimellä Verde. Hän on ollut jäsenenä yhtyeissä Ektroverde, Eturivi ja Kirvasto sekä tehnyt yhteistyötä muun muassa Circlen ja Otto Donnerin kanssa. Rintala on ollut myös ahkera konsertoija ja yhdistänyt viime aikoina konsertteja ja videotaidetta. Verden musiikin taustalla on sen teknologiapainottuneisuudesta huolimatta ekologinen ja luonnonsuojelullinen näkemys, tämä tulee esille erityisesti hänen valo- ja videokuvataiteessaan, jota hän on yhdistänyt musiikin esittämiseen.
KARRI JUTILA:
Syksyn Sävelessä 1983 Jonna esitti kappaleen "Minttu sekä Ville". Scops Karwin teki sen innoittamana (perheensä) joulumarkkinoille kolmannen kappaleensa "Matti sekä Teppo" (näitä edelsi "Eka piisi" ja "Toka piisi"). Vuodesta 1987 lähtien K on tehnyt sampleripoppia nimellä Beta5. Pari vuotta myöhemmin Hannu Blommila soitti B5:ttä Rockradion "Kellarinauhoissa". Sen jälkeen Rockradio lakkautettiin, Radiomafia kaappasi vallan, eikä B5 ole enää Yleisradiossa soinut. Albumeja on pöytälaatikossa vajaa 30, sisältäen mm. kokonaan linnunäänillä sävelletyn poplevyn. Linnunäänien soittaja Karwin pillittää myös didgeridoota, okariinaa sun muuta Verdessä, Vompatissa ja Voemalaetoksessa.
TERO HEIKKONEN:
Pirkanmaan kovin huuliharpisti ja thereminin soittaja.

The evening's program consist three live performances by following artists:

KATI ROOVER is a Helsinki-based, multidisciplinary artist. Her practice spans across the mediums of moving image, sound, photography, text and installations, draws upon and addresses a broad range of topics that are connected - from human, place and elemental interactions, mythopoetics, animisms and hydrofeminism, to the natural sciences and ecology.

http://www.katiroover.com

MIIO HOLOPAINEN is a musician, composer and sound designer. Their music and performance works often deal with the cultural tensions of their instruments, concert space and sounds. They are for example interested in “failure” that can happen during bow turns and instruments that in their own ways fail as fiddles but have something special as individuals. Their music pays attention to small but significant changes, decay, details and slow ways of becoming another. Scarcity, coincidence, susurrus, fumbling, mundaneness, simplicity and dust are present.

Miio Holopainen, violins, viola

J. KOHO works extensively with sound. Koho’s listening based artistic practice combines the methods, techniques and theories of acoustic, concrete, electronic, electroacoustic music and improvisation.

APRAPAT

Liput 10€

Mental Alaska tapahtuu helmikuussa ensimmäistä kertaa Äänen Lumon hallinnoimassa uudessa äänitaidetilassa Helsingin Vallilassa. Esiintymään saapuvat argentiinalainen Anla Courtis sekä Satatuhatta-levymerkin taustalla vaikuttavan Vilho Koiviston Aprapat-projekti.

APRAPAT
Aprapat eli Vilho Koivisto on noiseartisti, joka tunnetaan yksityiskohtaisen tarkasta metalliromumelusta sekä analogisista nauhamanipulaatioista. Aprapat on julkaissut useita kiiteltyjä albumeja eri levy-yhtiöillä ympäri maailmaa. Aprapatin live-setti ulottuu kokonaisvaltaisesta ja karkeastakin tykittelystä synkempiin ja rauhallisempiin äänimaisemiin. Aprapat yhdistää musiikissaan saumattomasti käsityötaidon ja draaman tajun. Koivisto on myös riemukkaan harsh noise-duo The New Boyfriendsin jäsen. Melun tekemisen ohella Koivisto pyörittää tuotteliasta Satatuhatta-levymerkkiä.

Valitettavasti tila, jossa tapahtuma järjestetään, ei ole täysin esteetön. Pääovelle on luiska, mutta sen jälkeen sisällä on 3-5 askelmaa, ja niiden vieressä oleva luiska on liian jyrkkä, jotta sitä voisi nousta yksin pyörätuolilla. 2. kerrokseen sitten hissillä, mutta hissille ei pääse ilman, että joku avaa oven. Tule siis jonkun kanssa, joka voi auttaa, tai ota yhteyttä järjestäjään, niin he auttavat.

Somagics is a movement practice developed by choreographer Laura Jantunen. At the center of Somagics is an intimate, detailed, and lively relationship with one's own sensory perception. Somagics Laboratory is a weekly gathering where Somagics is rehearsed. The aim of the classes is to research what Somagics is, what it can be, and how it can be choreographed. 

At Katve a few dancers from Somagics Laboratory dance for the first time to improvised music. Before we open the doors at 17:00 we’ll rehearse in the space for two hours together with the musicians. So everything you’ll see is very fresh.

SUMMARY:Transsonic (DE)
DESCRIPTION:Transsonic (Viola Yip and Nicola L. Hein) is a Berlin-based transmedia duo. Since 2018, they have been joining forces to develop new works at the intersection of instrument building, incorporating new technologies and developing embodied performance with sound and light.

They create immersive site-specific performances and installations bridging the vibrations of light and sound. Trained as musicians, both look into the ontology of sound and how musical experience can be transformed beyond its common material—sound. For their artistic research project Transsonic, they explore light as an expanded musical material. They research and create performances, improvising between lights and sounds as equally essential but dialectical musical materials.

They have been commissioned by Next Festival Bratislava, Hong Kong New Music Ensemble, Seanaps Festival Leipzig, and Gray Center for Arts and Inquiry at the University of Chicago. They have also presented at New York University, Experimental Intermedia (NYC), CCRMA at Stanford University, Internationales Musikinstitut Darmstadt, Sonic Lab in SARC at Queen's University Belfast, Huddersfield, Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, AIMC Conference at Oxford University, New Interface and Musical Expression (NIME) conference in Shanghai and Utrecht, Gare du Nord and Academy of Music Basel, Academy of Music Luzern, Klex Festival in Kuala Lumpur, Hong Kong Arts Center, De Tanker in Amsterdam, Musikhochschule Lübeck, Blurred Edges Festival in Hamburg, Alte Feuerwache in Köln, Experimentik Berlin and Radialsystem Berlin.

Viola Yip is an experimental composer, performer, sound artist, and instrument builder. She has been interested in creating new self-built instruments and sound performances that explore the dynamic relationships between media, materiality, space, and musical bodies in experimental music. Her recent appearance includes the Center for New Music and Audio Technologies (CNMAT) at UC Berkeley, Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA) at Stanford, Issue Project Room (NYC), Look & Listen Festival NYC, Art Club of Chicago, Cycling ‘74 Expo, School of Creative Media at the City University of Hong Kong, University of Huddersfield, Sonic Arts Research Center at Queen's University Belfast, QO-2 Brussels, Flykingen Stockholm, Kunst Station Sankt Peter (Köln), In Front festival Aachen, Heroines of Sound Berlin, Universität der Künste Berlin, Akademie der Künste Berlin, Museum Serralves Porto and Pinakothek der Moderne München. She received an Honorary Mention from Giga-Hertz-Preis 2021 at ZKM in Karlsruhe.

Livia Schweizer, flutes & more
Annika Fuhrmann, voice
Corinna Eickmeier (DE), cello
Iida-Vilhelmiina Sinivalo, cello

Corinna Eikmeier is known as a cellist,improvisation artist, Feldenkrais practitioner and professor for instrumental and vocal pedagogy at the Lübeck University of Music. For more info: https://www.corinna-eikmeier.de/

Annika Fuhrmann is a German-Finnish singer, musician, and sound artist who feels most at home in the fields of experimental music theater, sound art, and improvisation. She has premiered numerous works composed for her and has performed in interdisciplinary projects with artists from various fields. In recent years, she has actively sought to break away from her classical vocal training. Instead of technical perfection, she is drawn to honesty, roughness and incompleteness. At the moment Annika’s artistic work is supported by the Kone Foundation.

Iida-Vilhelmiina Sinivalo is a Helsinki-based freelance cellist who is particularly interested in the versatile expressive power offered by her instrument. She is currently delving into the subject area at the DocMus Doctoral School of the Sibelius Academy. Her approach to the instrument involves many different genres of music and thus seeks to expand the expressive overall image of the instrument. Sinivalo completed her Master's degree at the Sibelius Academy in the Department of Classical Music, with Arto Noras and Timo Hanhinen as her main teachers, after which she has worked extensively as a non-genre musician and pedagogue.

Livia Schweizer (b. 1994) is a flutist, improviser, educator, and artistic researcher based in Helsinki. She specializes in improvisation and non-conventional music notation to connect creative individuals from diverse backgrounds. After studying at the Conservatory of Livorno (Italy), she moved to Helsinki to study at the Sibelius Academy with Mikael Helasvuo. Livia is member of the European Composers Improvisers Orchestra and co-founded the Earth Ears Ensemble. Livia is a doctoral candidate at the Sibelius Academy, where her research focuses on non-conventional notation in intercultural collaboration. She also teaches at the International School of Helsinki, and advocates for introducing contemporary music to young audiences.

In the background the group exhibition 'Correspondence - kirjeenvaihto' , where is presented the results of a unique cultural exchange and dialogue in the form of original prints from fourteen different artists. Seven artists from Texas, USA and seven artists from Finland have created artworks on the themes of correspondence and communication. The printmaking techniques vary from woodcut to silkscreen and from etching to lithography. The works invite us to think about the connecting ties and shared experiences between individuals and communities.

Timo Tuhkanen
Timo Tuhkanen is an artist-composer, curator, and writer, whose work intersects between contemporary art, music, and research into the cultural and historical aspects of touch. Their work is concerned with designing and creating direct actions and socio-political interventions as an artistic practice through collective intelligence, relational aesthetics, and operational realism, and their subject matters often adapt inside an occupied environment of urban landscapes, digital platforms, and hydrosocial-spaces. Tuhkanen likes to describe their work as lived-through narrative fiction and mythopoetics, and they are interested in the psychological conflict between what is imaginable and what is realistically achievable and how this conflict materialises in the resources we construct.

Line up:
Mikko Innanen - wind instruments
Jukka Kääriäinen - guitar
Sam Ospovat - percussions


Mikko Innanen is a saxophonist, composer and bandleader from Finland, currently residing in Helsinki. A multifaceted and open-minded musician, he thrives in settings that span jazz’s past, present and future: be it in freely improvised solos, duos or trios, small and large ensembles playing his own compositions, or working as a sideman interpreting other people’s music.

Jukka Kääriäinen is a musician focused on experimental music. Depending on the situation, Jukka's instruments of choice include an acoustic guitar with preparations or an electric guitar with a bag full of effects. In addition to solo concerts, he regularly performs in bands and has collaborated with many leading European improvisers such as Teppo Hauta-Aho, Kalle Kalima, Harri Sjöström, Axel Dörner, Kriton Beyer, Rieko Okuda, Anil Eraslan, Mikko Innanen, and Joel Grip, premiering works by composers such as Riikka Talvitie, Sebastian Hilli, Sami Klemola, Clara de Asis, and Tytti Arola.

Sam Ospovat toured extensively throughout North America and Europe and worked with many notable musicians, including Lydia Lunch, Tim Dahl, Terry Riley, The San Francisco Contemporary Music Players, Weasel Walter, William Winant, Shahzad Ismaily, Ches Smith, Tuneyards, and Bill McHenry. Ospovat was extremely fortunate to work closely with Cecil Taylor, Wadada Leo Smith, and Maryanne Amacher while at Mills College, where he earned his MFA in 20th century Percussion Performance and Literature, and is in the 2005 Cecil documentary All the Notes. event_venue123 Musta Kissa

SUMMARY:Rahina-klubi: Marcus Wärnheim - Jonathan Bäckström + Wilson Tanner Smith 
DESCRIPTION:Swedish alto saxophonist Marcus Wärnheim and Finnish double bass player Jonathan Bäckström have been playing together as a duo since 2018. Through a long-lasting close collaborative process they are consequently pushing the limits of the intimate duo setting, exploring sound by embracing the spontaneous, pre-determined and arbitrary.

Marcus Wärnheim is a Swedish alto saxophonist and improviser, currently based in Amsterdam. His artistic output is primarily based in a genuine curiosity of sound, which he works with through intense listening and a thorough research of the physical possibilities of his instrument. In recent years he has been preoccupied with acoustic solo performances, improvisational meetings, interpretation of other’s compositions as a sideman, as well as trans-disciplinary collaborations with dancers and circus artists.

Jonathan Bäckström is a Finnish double bassist and composer. He works within the broader spectrum of jazz, free improvisation and contemporary music. He is currently pursuing the master’s program at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm. In spring 2024 he debuted as a leader on the Finnish record label We Jazz Records with a critically acclaimed quartet album. During the span of ten years, he has worked extensively as a side musician and freelancer both in Finland and internationally. With his compositional
work, he is blending written material with free improvisation, aiming to create a microcosm that explores the relationship between performer and composer, fostering an environment of innovation and reflection.

SUMMARY:FANTASIA 6
DESCRIPTION:SIRPA KALLA
ILPO NUMMINEN
ELATU NESSA

Mental Alaska and El Fant bring experimental music to Market Square!
****************

Sirpa Kalla was born in 2024 in Portugal, in the dunes of Adraga. She thrives on unintentionally generated sounds, the atmosphere of old industrial areas and the roughness and rasp of rust and debris. Sirpa Kalla cuts random loops from cassettes found in the streets and abandoned buildings, combining them with minimalist synths and contact mic'd objects.

Ilpo Numminen is a synthesizer artist who draws inspiration from the craftsman-like spirit of the early days of electronic music. Stylistically this can mean, for example, cosmic sequence music or anything between simple sounds and multi-layered chaos.

Rusto Myllylahti's solo project Elatu Nessa is a combination of homemade loops, psychedelic guitars, birdsong, human voice, dreaming, poor data and naps. It's the soundtrack to desert dreams, snowy fields and imaginary computers. event_venue123 El Fant

Kaaosta jälki ei kuitenkaan ollut, vaan tarttumapintoja löytyi rutkasti niin kokonaisuudesta kuin yksilöiden toiminnasta. Tietty rockmaisuus oli koko ajan läsnä, ei vähiten herkullisella säröllä jytisseen sähköbasson vuoksi. Myös rumpalilla oli erittäin persoonallinen, omalla rupisella tavallaan hyvin gruuvaava tatsi. Pekkolan sooloissa oli alati ideaa, vaikka ne vyöryivät päälle hurjalla kiihkolla."

HELI HARTIKAINEN
Heli Hartikainen on saksofonisti, klarinetisti, säveltäjä, improvisoija ja äänitaiteilija, joka puskee instrumenttinsa (ja itsensä) rajoja jatkuvasti yhä pidemmälle. Hartikaisen luovan toiminnan ytimessä on kokeellisuus, jossa abstraktion ja eksistentiaalisen uteliaisuuden kanssa kietoutuu leikkisästi yhteen kyltymätön rakkaus ääntä kohtaan. Hartikaisen albumi ”Chronovariations” on ehdolla vuoden jazzalbumi Emma-palkinnon saajaksi Emma Gaala 2025 -tapahtumassa.

HENRI IJÄS & PETRI PIETIKÄINEN
Melodioiden ja abstraktin polveileva resonanssi, voimaannuttava intensiteetti ja ennalta suunnittelemattomasti improvisoitu kurottautuminen yhä lähemmäs kohti ydinääntä. Henri Ijäksen (Solar Unity Ensemble, Kartat) ja Petri Pentikäisen (World Mänkeri Orchestra, Kartat) vuorovaikutus synnyttää kiehtovaa vapaasti vaeltavaa äänimaisemointia.

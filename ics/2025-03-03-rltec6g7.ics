SUMMARY:Shafeeq Alsadi & Jano Doe // negatiiviviiva // Timo Tuhkanen
DESCRIPTION:Shafeeq Alsadi & Jano Doe  
Shafeeq Alsadi is a Palestinian singer, qanun player, and composer from Bethlehem. His improvised sets are deeply rooted in the Arabic musical tradition. His collaboration with Slovak musician Jano Doe, an experimental player of DIY modular synthesizers, creates unexpected musical landscapes filled with shared restlessness, anger, and sorrow over the reality of a crumbling world.  
For this concert the duo will be joined by Saku Liimatainen, a musician from Helsinki focused on electronic composition, music production, and piano pedagogy.

Timo Tuhkanen  
Timo Tuhkanen is an artist-composer, curator, and writer, whose work intersects between contemporary art, music, and research into the cultural and historical aspects of touch. Their work is concerned with designing and creating direct actions and socio-political interventions as an artistic practice through collective intelligence, relational aesthetics, and operational realism, and their subject matters often adapt inside an occupied environment of urban landscapes, digital platforms, and hydrosocial-spaces. Tuhkanen likes to describe their work as lived-through narrative fiction and mythopoetics, and they are interested in the psychological conflict between what is imaginable and what is realistically achievable and how this conflict materialises in the resources we construct.

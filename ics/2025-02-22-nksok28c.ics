METRIC is an international network of several leading European conservatoires, dedicated to advancing improvisation teaching in higher music education. While many of its members are active in the broader improvisation scene, this concert aims to connect with the Finnish creative community, especially those not affiliated with any institution, which is often the case in free improvisation communities. The Sibelius Academy is a member of the Metric network.  
  
Äänen Lumo association promotes experimental sonic arts in Finland, and faciliates interaction, communality and exchange between artists, associations and collectives.  
  
Äänen Lumo Space is a new community-driven, low threshold, DIY space for presenting, practicing, and encountering sound based art practices.

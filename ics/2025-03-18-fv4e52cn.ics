SUMMARY:Mercedes Krapovickas - BanÂ­doÂ­neon ResÂ­oÂ­nance #1: Neons & NeuÂ­trals
DESCRIPTION:Bandoneon Resonance #1: Neons & Neutrals is the first of four concerts in Mercedes Krapovickasâ€™ doctoral research project, Bandoneon Resonance: Exploring Contemporary Soundscapes. This solo bandoneon and live-electronics performance explores the instrumentâ€™s transformation through extended techniques, movement, and technology, turning the bandoneon into an augmented instrument and Krapovickas into an augmented performer. The multichannel concert explores how traditional instruments can transform through electronic interaction.  
  
There will be two performances, the first one starting at 19:00 and the second at 20:00.  
  
Even though the concert is free, you need to reserve your seats in advance.

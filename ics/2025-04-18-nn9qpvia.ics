SUMMARY:Suhina Klubi: Les Marquises
DESCRIPTION:Suhina Klubi serves as a platform for improvised and experimental music and sound art within Helsinki. During the year 2025 we present improvised music ensembles from Finland and abroad.  
  
In the fourth edition of Suhina Klubi for the spring 2025, we are proud to host duo Les Marques.  
  
Les Marquises is a duo of free improv music, led by French accordion and turntable player Emilie Skrijelj, and Belgian drummer tom Malmendier.  
Two voices breathe together, exchange, scramble and curl up like a twining plant. A dance on the embers, ardent Marquises ...  
  
They released two albums as a duo, and a few in collaboration with other artists, such as Mike Ladd, Michael Thieke, Elio Amberg, and soon Otomo Yoshihide.  
They played shows all over Europe, and will be for the very first time in Finland.

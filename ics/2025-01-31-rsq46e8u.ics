SUMMARY:Select your player 
DESCRIPTION:Select Your Player is an interactive performance where four improvisers take the audience on a  
sonic journey inspired by game concepts composed specifically for this occasion. In the first piece,  
the audience follows the performers through a game of snakes and ladders. The second piece  
plunges the audience into a frantic race between the musicians: who will be the first to win the  
game? The audience is invited to participate and interfere in the race... The final piece explores  
listening and the subtle communication between musicians, where the game rules are sometimes...  
bent. An invitation to participate, listen, and experiment.  
Players:  
Jan Škrobánek, piano  
Laura Mehmeti, accordion  
Franziska Fundelić, flute  
Jaime Estévez Moreira, saxophone  
Concept by Laura Mehmeti

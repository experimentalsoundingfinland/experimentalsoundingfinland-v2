SUMMARY:KATVE - COMMUNAL SCORE HAPPENING
DESCRIPTION:In four hours we will collectively create and perform a score (set of instructions) in Katve.   
  
you are welcome to:  
1. hang out, drink tea and observe  
2. write scores / instructions for things to happen in the space during 14:00-18:00  
3. perform the score  
  
There is no need for any specific skill set to participate!  
  
you can join for the whole duration or pop by for a shorter visit!  
  
Everyone is welcome to perform parts of the score on the spot with or without an instrument. So bring something to play with if you wish!  
  
How to make an instruction for our collective Katve score:   
  
Together we create instructions for sound, movement, gestures and other things to happen in the space between 14-18. We will have a clock on the wall and papers and pens where to write instructions. To create an instruction, write or draw an instruction to a piece of paper and tape it to the wall.   
  
An example of a written piece of instruction: “15:35 - whistle as quietly as you can for a duration of one breath”

Anla Courtis is a musician and composer from Buenos Aires. Courtis’ experimental music combines sound samples and manipulations with both traditional and special, self-made, instruments. Courtis has released hundreds of recordings as a solo artist and in numerous collaborative projects. He is a founding member of the Argentinian 90’s cult band Reynols.  
  
Tomutonttu is a solo project by Tampere-based multi-artist Jan Anderzén. Anderzén, a visual artist working with textiles, drawings, prints and sound sculptures, is as a musician best known for his work with the band Kemialliset Ystävät, founded in 1995. Tomutonttu’s music is a collage of different sounds, sometimes recognisable from the animal world, and electronic experimental music.

SUMMARY:Dear Society, : Club Grief
DESCRIPTION:Club Grief is a club night for all grievers and friends.   
  
Club Grief is born out of the wish to allow grievers or grieving individuals to go clubbing in times where a normal club might not feel as the safest option. Dancing, clubbing and music hold the potential to host grief and to let grief come to the surface, yet, most clubs are high-threshold for grieving individuals due to the pressure to perform in a certain (happy/uplifted/party-proof/exhilarating/excited) way.   
  
There is little room for tears on the dancing floor and Club Grief tries to change that. We invite all types of grievers to bring their grief to the dancing floor, whatever this might look [like.The](http://like.The) anonymity and the freedom of emotions on the dancing floor can act facilitating in the navigation of the sometimes new or scary feelings of loss and grief, while dancing and movement can help us deal with emotional pain.  
  
Welcome to Club Grief with music provided by Death by Landscape and M Lore, come to dance, cry and hold each other or take a little breather in the soft space by Leik Silvestrini.

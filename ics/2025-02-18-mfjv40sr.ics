SENSORY CLAY - WORKSHOP  
  
BY MIKKO KELLONIEMI WITH SOUNDS OF EETU VEKKI & MIKKO SARVANNE  
  
Mikko Kelloniemi will lead us through a blindfolded journey with clay, guided by sound textures created live by Eetu Vekki & Mikko Sarvanne.  
  
No theme, topic or framework. Close your eyes and tune into the sound, into yourself. Feel the clay in your hands and experience the material. See where it takes you without the guidance of sight.  
  
There is room for 10 participants. Secure your spot by sending email to katvetila@[gmail.com](http://gmail.com) or pass by to see if you can fit.
